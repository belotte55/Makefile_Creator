# Makefile_Creator

To use it easily, cp all files to a PATHed dir.

To create a Makefile for a program:
```
Makefile_Creator
```

To create a Makefile for a lib:
```
Makefile_Creator libX.a
```

All C files are added automatically.
All libs presents in the dir are added automatically to be compiled.
